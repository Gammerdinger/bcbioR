<!-- badges: start -->

[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/bcbio/bcbioR/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bcbio/bcbioR/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml) <!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `bcbioR` is to create guidelines for NGS data interpretation based on the experience of the Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core and everybody who contributes to this package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of bcbioR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bcbio/bcbioR")
```

## Quick start

``` r
library(bcbioR)
## basic example code
# will help you to build a folder name following HCBC naming rules
bcbio_set_project()
```

### Set base project

The following code will pop up a Rmd template and then clicking 'save' will populate that folder with HCBC data structure guidelines

``` r
rmarkdown::draft("project_folder",template="common",package="bcbioR")
```

As well, You can get this by going to File -\> New File -\> R markdown: - then `From Template`, and choose `bcbio base` - choose the folder to deploy files, it could be a new folder or an existing one

### Set RNAseq report folder

This code will populate the folder with HCBC data structure guidelines and Rmd code:

``` r
bcbio_templates(type="rnaseq", outpath="test_folder/reports")
```

## How to Contribute

### Open an issue

* If you find a bug
* If you want a new feature
* If you want to add code to the templates

### Modify the code

* Clone the repository
* Make sure you are in the `devel` branch
* Create a new branch `git checkout -b feature1`
* Modify you code, add and commit
* Push to GitHub the new branch
* Create a PR from your branch to `devel`
* Assignt the PR to me or Alex

Some best practices when developing:

* install `devtools`
* render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
* Use `usethis::use_import_from("stringr","str_replace_all")` to add a new function you are using in the code.
