The goal of bcbioR is to create guidelines for NGS data interpretation
based on the experience of the Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core and
everybody who wants to contribute.

## Installation

You can install the development version of bcbioR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bcbio/bcbioR")
```

## Example

``` r
library(bcbioR)
## basic example code
```

## How to Contribute

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

Use `usethis::use_import_from()` to make sure all the imports are
correct.

Don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they
display on GitHub and CRAN.
